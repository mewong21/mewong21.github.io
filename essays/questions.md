## Silly Questions

  There isn’t one person who knows everything about coding and computer science. It’s very rare where someone runs their code and it works perfectly the first time without any bugs. That’s why websites like StackOverflow are important to developers, it’s a place where people can share ideas and learn from each other. However, it is also important to ask “smart” questions.
  “Smart” questions are questions that are asked by people who have already done their research. People who have already tried to find the answer to their own question, providing the information they had learned and the resources to their question to help the readers better answer the question. For example this person asked a “smart” question, they asked “Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?” This person provided the links that they had researched on and included their code to help the readers understand their problem. They also even provided data, where they timed the time it took to process these arrays. At the end of their post they bullet pointed their questions to make the readability easier as well and their thought process. Here’s a link to the question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array
  A question that isn’t “smart” is someone whose answer could be answered easily with a Google search. It shows that they didn’t put the effort to learn and just wanted someone to give them the answer. Like this example where someone asks, “Is there any difference in performance between the conditional operator === and the assignment operator =?” This answer is something that could be searched up, and there’s no need for a thread to be posted. I’ve provided the link to the question here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17686749/javascript-performance-conditional-statement-vs-assignment-operator
