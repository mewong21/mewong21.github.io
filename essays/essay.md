## My Path in Computer Science

  Since I was young I have always had an interest in computers and technology. My parents taught me how to use a keyboard and mouse when I was 2 and by the time I was 10 I had a full PC setup and was playing games all day. My parents encouraged me to learn coding through Khan Academy every Sunday, I was always frustrated and I would cry doing the problems because I didn’t understand. But now I am forever grateful to my parents for introducing me to computer science because it has become something that I am passionate about.
	I enjoy solving problems with code and making applications that people can use. In addition to writing code, I also like to design the UI and the theme of the applications. Projects that I have so far have been for fun and always involve my cat. I’ve made a mobile app that has a laser pointer for my cat and a to-do list that has my cat pop up when a task is finished. Although these projects don’t really solve a problem or increase efficiency, I enjoy making them because I get to create something that comes from my imagination and customize it to how I want it.
I hope to improve my problem solving skills as I continue my education. I also hope to improve my soft skills and make many new connections. I think these are very important skills for anyone and it’d really help me in the future. I want to continue learning more about all the different topics in computer science and hopefully find the area that I am most passionate about so I can pursue it as my career.
