## ICS 314: A Gateway into Software Engineering

For me, 314 was the gateway into software engineering. In my past ICS classes I had learned how to make programs that could only be interacted with in the terminal, it was very limited. However, in this class I was able to create actual websites for real users to interact with.

One of the most important topics I took away from this class is User Interface Frameworks. Being introduced to Vercel, Next.js, React, and Bootstrap completely changed my view on website development. These tools tremendously helped with making dynamic websites. Being able to store data and use the data in the code was very fun to learn. I can definitely see myself using these tools to create websites outside of class, for example I could create a website for a store that I work at.

Another lesson that I took away from this class is Agile Project Management. The final project for 314 really taught me how to manage a project and work with a team. I learned more features about GitHub like Projects, issues, and the backlog. Although these skills seem small or less important they are foundational skills that all developers should have if they want to work with teams in the future. Even knowing how to split work and communicate with team members is a very important skill that I learned.

This class has introduced me to what it’s like to work on actual projects on my own and with a team. The lessons taught in this class will be used in the future even when I graduate and get a job.
