## ESGlint
I never knew there could be so many errors with my coding format. When I first started using ESLint many red squiggly lines popped up and I was so confused as to why. When I hovered over them they said that the EOF line needs to end on a new line. I never knew there were so many standards to follow. At first I found them to be tedious to fix but after a while I got used to them and they make my code look nicer.
	Despite all the errors I get from ESLint I think coding standards are important. I always have trouble looking at other people’s code because their format is different from how I code and it isn’t something I am used to, so it takes time for me to adjust. But with standards it makes code reviews easier since everyone's code is formatted the same it’s what I’m used to. It also helps people like me who aren't good at writing nicely formatted code. It’s similar to how when we write essays there are different formats to follow like MLA or APA, they all help ensure consistency and make work easier to read so time can be focused on the content.
	Another benefit of using ESLint is that it does more than just fix formatting. It can also catch potential errors in my code before I even run it, which saves me time and frustration later. For example, it might warn me about variables I declared but never used, or about functions that could cause unexpected behavior. These small reminders help me build better habits and write cleaner, more reliable programs. Over time, I’ve started to appreciate these tools because they teach me to think more carefully about the code I’m writing instead of only focusing on whether it works.
