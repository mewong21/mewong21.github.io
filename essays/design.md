## Coding with Bricks
When people think of coding or computer science they think of the stereotypical in a dark basement, typing away at the computer for hours. But for me I think coding is like building legos. You come up with an idea you want to build and you use the legos to build it, initially it might not come out how you pictured it at first but then you fix and tweak it to how you want. During the process you might also come up with an idea to add that you didn't have originally.

When people build with legos there are common ways people build things. For example, building a house, usually you make a square or rectangle frame and build up the walls. You put longer pieces on the bottom and maybe put it on top of a large flat lego piece for the “ground.” Then you add the roof. Even lego sets that you buy, everyone follows the same instruction book to start. This is similar to design patterns in computer science, it’s a general format or solution to common problems. But usually you don’t stop there. You add to the solution or your lego house to make it more personal and fit how you wanted it.

In our final ICS 314 project, we use design patterns in many components. For one example, we have a card template to hold our recipes. Each card has an image, preparation time, tags, and the title. Then we reuse each card and customize it for the specific recipe. The card component takes in those data and puts it for us. If we had to make a new card each time it’s time consuming and very repetitive.

Design patterns make reusability much easier and it saves a lot of time in projects. It also makes it easier for people to read and follow the code. Just like legos there are templates and sets that you can follow and later customize.
