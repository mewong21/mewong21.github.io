## html 😡😡😡
At first, learning Bootstrap 5 felt overwhelming because of the large number of new classes and components it introduced. It was challenging to remember what each class did and how to properly combine them to achieve the layout I wanted. However, as I spent more time building websites, I began to see how efficient Bootstrap really is. Instead of writing long blocks of custom CSS, I could achieve responsive, well-aligned layouts with just a few lines of code. Once I understood more about the classes and different elements, I was able to design websites that looked clean much faster than before.
Using Bootstrap 5 didn’t just make my workflow efficient, it also improved how I think about structuring web pages. By working within its system, I learned how to organize my HTML more clearly and how elements should fit together for better readability and responsiveness. The framework encouraged me to plan my layout before writing any code. In the end, while Bootstrap 5 took time to learn, it became a valuable tool that not only sped up development but also helped me grow as a web developer by reinforcing good design and coding practices.
