I needed a way to keep track of the tasks I had to do on my laptop, so I decided to make my own. It's an application that has a transparent background. You can add multiple tasks and when a task is completed my cat shows up.
For this project I used Electron to build this app. I used CSS to change the background and animate my cat showing up. The to do list logic was done in JavaScript.
