## Rainbow Recipes
[Rainbow Recipes Project Page](https://rainbow-recipes.github.io/)

With a team I helped create a website whose purpose was to provide a website for UH students to share their recipes as well as see other students' recipes. Students can create accounts and post, view, or favorite recipes. The website is also connected with vendors in the area to help provide information on where to buy ingredients.

In this project I worked on creating a detailed recipe page, a favorites page, an "I'm feeling lucky!" page, and updated the home page through each milestone. I also implemented features like add and editing recipes, validating form inputs, and allowed users to edit and delete their own recipes. I learned a lot from this project, it taught me how ot work in a team and manage a project.
